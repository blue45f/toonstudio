# ToonStudio engineering field notes

## Purpose

The public field-notes route documents implementation patterns that can be reused outside ToonStudio. It is not a marketing dependency list and does not turn a design candidate into a live product claim.

The typed content source is:

```text
apps/web/src/domains/legal/technology/engineering-field-notes-content.ts
```

The route is:

```text
/about/technology/field-notes
```

## Repository-verified inventory

The page publishes review-date-bound implementation counts and tests them against the repository:

- 64 dedicated `*.worker.ts` entries;
- 58 `*worker-client.ts` boundaries;
- 9 non-test service-worker runtime modules;
- 2 browser-local inference runtimes: ONNX Runtime Web and MediaPipe Tasks Vision;
- 8 allowlisted Blender MCP commands;
- 8 documented Open API entries (the page documents eight providers in detail; the server resource engine registers more, 26 provider ids in `packages/core/src/creator-resources.ts`).

The counts are evidence, not a feature-quality score. They exist to make architecture claims auditable and to fail tests when the implementation drifts.

## Content groups

### Worker topology

Workers are scoped by workload rather than shared as a universal background thread. Every protocol documents:

- request identity and response schema;
- byte, queue and memory limits;
- transferable ownership;
- timeout and cancellation;
- late-result fencing;
- fatal cleanup and worker recreation;
- the explicit main-thread commit boundary.

A worker may calculate, decode, validate or render, but it does not own the canonical project document.

### PWA and offline runtime

The PWA section separates runtime caching from project storage:

- service-worker caches contain reproducible runtime assets;
- OPFS, SQLite and recovery journals contain work state;
- APIs remain network-only;
- navigation and immutable assets use different strategies;
- generated precache plans carry schema and content hashes;
- activation is controlled and reload loops have an emergency cleanup path.

### Browser-local AI

ONNX Runtime Web and MediaPipe Tasks Vision are treated as capability-bound local providers rather than universal offline fallbacks. The contracts cover:

- model ID, version, SHA-256 and input/output schema;
- model and tensor byte budgets before allocation;
- explicit WebGPU or WASM provider selection in the generic provider with no silent backend retry (the modules for the five ONNX features, e.g. tag2pix, keep a WebGPU-first, WASM-second route ladder whose consistency with ADR-0018 §12 is an open check);
- request, stroke and document epoch fencing;
- webcam and model-origin consent boundaries;
- process-wide FIFO initialization for MediaPipe task factories that share ambient module state.

### AI-assisted engineering

AI assists repository search, drafts, review suggestions, documentation, test candidates and bounded Blender operations. Completion still requires ordinary diffs, deterministic tests, browser evidence, license/security gates and human approval.

MCP tools expose typed, outcome-oriented commands and do not grant arbitrary shell, network, `eval` or `exec`. AI review configuration is never treated as proof that a review actually ran; PR comments, workflow runs and artifacts are checked separately.

### Free-first AI

Free-first AI is an operating policy:

- exact provider/model allowlists;
- explicit operator confirmation;
- durable quota and idempotency records;
- safe advance only after machine-verifiable pre-inference rejection (402/429 and provider-verified quota codes; in the server shared pool 401/403 authentication errors do not advance, while personal-key routes pass that key's 401/403 on to the next free route);
- no retry after ambiguous timeout, 5xx or malformed success;
- BYOK credentials scoped to explicit work and never used as a silent fallback;
- no hidden model, resolution or output-quality downgrade.

### Minimum-cost infrastructure

The infrastructure note separates static delivery, edge liveness, dynamic API, realtime rooms, large immutable objects and the durable ledger. Supabase PostgreSQL is the current ledger authority and Neon is preserved as legacy (see `docs/operations/canonical-database-topology.md`). It also documents cold starts, free-tier ceilings and the absence of automatic paid promotion.

A reviewed immutable commit SHA and release receipt are required for production changes.

### Blender MCP and 3D

The Blender facade is an allowlisted command surface, not an arbitrary Python or shell executor. Browser-owned project documents remain authoritative. Blender is used for bounded DCC work such as topology, shape keys, hair LODs, MToon/VRM output, review renders and packaging.

The realtime 3D architecture keeps one Scene3D document and projects it into a primary Three runtime or explicitly activated specialist kernels. Engine objects are not persisted as project truth.

### Open APIs

Every provider entry records:

- official endpoint and authentication requirements;
- response schema and request budgets;
- rights predicates and source attribution;
- image and link host allowlists;
- cache and rate-limit behavior;
- timeout, schema-drift and partial-failure handling.

Public API access, public-domain metadata and asset redistribution are kept as separate decisions.

### Troubleshooting

Each incident-style entry follows the same structure:

```text
symptom → root cause → fix → prevention → repository evidence
```

Only failures with inspectable implementation or regression evidence are presented as resolved.

## Reference products

Reference products are labelled with one of five roles:

| Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `applied-pattern` | a public workflow or quality pattern was translated into a product contract |
| `specialist` | a bounded external tool is used without owning product authority |
| `reference-only` | quality or architecture reference, not embedded in the product |
| `planned-evaluation` | candidate with explicit gates, not a live feature |
| `not-adopted` | deliberately excluded because of duplicated authority, cost or compatibility |

Do not copy commercial assets, private APIs, protected UI or non-public implementation details when updating these notes.

## Review rules

Official documentation links carry a review date (2026-10-07 for the current set, after every link was reopened). Recheck provider pricing, free tiers, browser support, API terms, model identifiers and engine support before implementation or publication.

Public field-note content must never include:

- secrets, tokens or real account identifiers;
- private endpoints or operational access details;
- unpublished exploit steps;
- claims that a candidate or harness is live;
- claims that a free tier is unlimited or guaranteed.
